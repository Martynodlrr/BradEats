# Brad Eats

This Is a group project we did for our second project during our time at App Academy. Brad Eats is a Uber Eats clone. As a user, you can create an account, view restaurants, view menu items, add or delete from your cart and create a order. As a restaurant owner, you have the ability to create, read, update and delete a restaurant, or menu items.
